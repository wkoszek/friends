Mostly simple C and C++ stuff written for friends. If you see this do know
you've come to the dark side of the Internet and this repository is a piece
of junk which is unlikely to be useful to you!

# How to build

Just type:

	make

# How to run

Each `.c` and `.cc` file will compile to its own program. Just run the
program to see the result.
